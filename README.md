1.	Aim of the activity: - 
	To change the voltage using potentiometer (POT_ADC) and to display it on LCD.
	To measure the room temperature and to display it on the LCD.

	Simulator Used: -
1.	Code Composer Studio
Code Composer Studio software comprises a suite of tools used to develop and debug embedded applications. The software includes an optimizing C/C++ compiler, source code editor, project build environment, debugger, profiler and many other features.

2.	MSP430 Lunchbox
The MSP430 can be used for low powered embedded devices. The current drawn in idle mode can be less than 1 µA. The top CPU speed is 25 MHz It can be throttled back for lower power consumption.
 

	Problem statement/ Ideation: 
Due to covid-19 our life as disrupted, as we know that virus is spreading in community at a large scale. The person also gets infected if he/she comes in contact with any infected living/non-living thing. To stop this chain, we are contributing it, suppose we are the place of an infected person due some emergency condition and we are in the situation to press the doorbell but on the other hand we are worried that if we press the button there are chances that we get infected. so to cope up with this problem we have come whit the idea.

	List of the components used: - 

	MSP430; The MSP430 can be used for low powered embedded devices. The current drawn in idle mode can be less than 1 µA. The top CPU speed is 25 MHz It can be throttled back for lower power consumption.

	hooked up wire: Hook-up wire is a family of wire with a single (solid or stranded) insulated conductor used for making internal connections in low current, low voltage (< 600V) applications.

	Buzzer: A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device,[1] which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

	LCD:  A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit light directly, instead using a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome.

	IR sensor: An infrared sensor is an electronic device, that emits in order to sense some aspects of the surroundings. An IR sensor can measure the heat of an object as well as detects the motion. These types of sensors measure only infrared radiation, rather than emitting it that is called a passive IR sensor.

	Potentiometer:  A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.

	Resistor: A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage.

	Jumper wire: 
A jump wire (also known as jumper, jumper wire, jumper cable, DuPont wire or cable) is an electrical wire, or group of them in a cable, with a connector or pin at each end (or sometimes without them – simply "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components of a breadboard or other prototype or test circuit, internally or with other equipment or components, without soldering.

	USB cable: Universal Serial Bus is an industry standard that establishes specifications for cables and connectors and protocols for connection, communication and power supply between computers, peripherals and other computers. A broad variety of USB hardware exists, including eleven different connectors, of which USB-C is the most recent.

	Results: 
Let's talk about the working of this project. suppose there are guest in front of main  door of your home and the doorbell automatically will rang.
          Here what happen its that when person comes. In front of door The IR sensor senses
          The person and send signal to MSP430 Gives Command to Buzzer and LCD which 
          the someone here “YES” and notifies the owner/person. If the guests enters in home 
          IR sensor will sense nothing at the door and the buzzer will stop and followed by 
          Which lcd will give output that SOMEONE HERE “NO”.  


	Application: - This contact less doorbell can be used at door.
	Home.
	Offices.
	Malls.
	Shops. 
	Place where high security is required.
